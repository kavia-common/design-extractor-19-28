This folder will contain auto-generated artifacts:

- manifest-<prefix>.json: mapping of Figma node IDs to exported filenames.
- figma-export-<prefix>/: a static mini-site previewing the extracted assets.

Files are produced by scripts/extract_figma_assets.py. You can open figma-export-<prefix>/index.html to preview assets.
