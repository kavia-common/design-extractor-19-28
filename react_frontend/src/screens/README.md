This folder contains React components converted from the static HTML/CSS produced from Figma.

- SignUp.jsx: Converted from assets/sign-up-30-403.html and assets/sign-up-30-403.css
- SignIn.jsx: Converted from assets/sign-in-11-235.html and assets/sign-in-11-235.css
- Home.jsx: Converted from assets/home-17-80.html and assets/home-17-80.css

All components import shared variables from assets/common.css. Behavior previously in assets/app.js has been minimally integrated with useEffect event listeners for preview parity.
